# quicktext
Gnome-shell extension for quickly inserting notes into a file

Designed to work with just about any text-based note taking app, this extension simply inserts snippets (with an optional prefix and suffix) into a given text file.

The hot-key combination (`<ctrl> + <super> + i` by default) can be configured as well as the destination file.

The destination file name and path must be set before using the extension and the file must exist.
